    Nestor Ivanovych Makhno or Bat'ko ("Father") Makhno[1] (Ukrainian: Не́стор Івáнович Махно́; October 26, 1888 (N.S. November 7) –
    July 25, 1934)[2][3] was a Ukrainian anarcho-communist revolutionary and the commander of an independent anarchist army in
    Ukraine in 1917–22.

    As commander of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, commonly referred to as the Makhnovshchina,
    Makhno led a guerrilla campaign. Makhnovshchina can be loosely translated as "Makhno movement".
    The term encompasses not only the army but the whole of the movement's activities and overall spirit.
    The suffix -shchina can be employed in a slightly derogatory manner, but this is not the intention in this case,
    given that the movement's adherents – including Makhno himself – frequently used the term to describe themselves.
